// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Create the API

- Initialize the project
  ```bash
  operator-sdk init --domain qinkeith.com --repo github.com/qinkeith/operators/memcached/golang
  ```
  - `--repo=` is required when creating a project outsile of `$GOPATH/src` as scaffolding api needs a valid module path
  - [go.mod](./go.mod): used to work with Go modules
  - [Makefilei](./Makefile): Make targets for building/deploying your controller
  - [PROJECT](./PROJECT): Metadata for scaffolding new components
  - [main.go](./main.go): the entrypoint of your controller
    - imports [controller-runtime library](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime) and it's logging
    - [Schema](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/gvks.html#err-but-whats-that-scheme-thing): provides mappings between Kinds and their corresponding Go types. 

- Scalfold the API
  ```bash
  operator-sdk create api --group cache --version v1alpha1 --kind Memcached --resource --controller
  ```
  - Modify [api/v1alpha1/memcached_types.go](./api/v1alpha1/memcached_types.go) to add `size` and  `nodes` to `Spec` and `Status`
  - Update `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` by running
    ```bash
    make generate
    ```
  - Create the CRD manifests at [config/crd/bases/cache.qinkeith.com_memcacheds.yaml](./config/crd/bases/cache.qinkeith.com_memcacheds.yaml) by running
    ```bash
    make manifests
    ```

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/golang:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/golang:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
