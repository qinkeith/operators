## Create the API

- Initialize the project
  ```bash
  operator-sdk init --domain qinkeith.com --repo github.com/qinkeith/operators/memcached/golang
  ```
  - `--repo=` is required when creating a project outsile of `$GOPATH/src` as scaffolding api needs a valid module path
  - [go.mod](./go.mod): used to work with Go modules
  - [Makefilei](./Makefile): Make targets for building/deploying your controller
  - [PROJECT](./PROJECT): Metadata for scaffolding new components
  - [main.go](./main.go): the entrypoint of your controller
    - imports [controller-runtime library](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime) and it's logging
    - [Schema](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/gvks.html#err-but-whats-that-scheme-thing): provides mappings between Kinds and their corresponding Go types. 

- Scalfold the API
  ```bash
  operator-sdk create api --group cache --version v1alpha1 --kind Memcached --resource --controller
  ```
  - Modify [api/v1alpha1/memcached_types.go](./api/v1alpha1/memcached_types.go) to add `size` and  `nodes` to `Spec` and `Status`
  - Generate code for DeepCopy:. [zz_generated.deepcopy.go](api/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go) by running [make generate](./Makefile#L93)
  - Generate WebhookConfiguration, ClusterRole and CustomResourceDefinition objects for the CRD at [config/crd/bases/cache.qinkeith.com_memcacheds.yaml](./config/crd/bases/cache.qinkeith.com_memcacheds.yaml) by running [make manifests](./Makefile#L89)
    - The controller needs certain RBAC permissions to interact with the resources it manages. These are specified via RBAC markers like the following:
      ```marker
      //+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=cache.qinkeith.com,resources=memcacheds,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete
      //+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=cache.qinkeith.com,resources=memcacheds/status,verbs=get;update;patch
      //+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=cache.qinkeith.com,resources=memcacheds/finalizers,verbs=update
      ```
       in controllers/memcached_controller.go. `make manifest` creates the ClusterRole manifest at [config/rbac/role.yaml](./config/rbac/role.yaml) 
  
  Note, both `make generate` and `make manifests` will call [controller-gen](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools) utility.

- Implement the Controller
  - Reference the instance you want to observe. In our case, it's the Memcached object definded in [api/v1alpha1/memcached_types.go](https://github.com/qinkeith/operators/blob/main/memcached/golang/api/v1alpha1/memcached_types.go#L43). This can be achieved by importing the Memcached CRD from the `cachev1alpha1` object:
    
    ```golang
      import (
        ...
        cachev1alpha1 "github.com/qinkeith/operators/memcached/golang/api/v1alpha1"
      )	
    ```
   
    `cachev1alpha1.<Object>{}` can be used to reference any of the defined objects within that memcached_types.go. For example:

    ```golang
    memcached := &cachev1alpha1.Memcached{}
    ``` 
  
  - The [Reconcile](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/reconcile) method - The Reconcile [method](https://go.dev/tour/methods/1) is 
  a function with MemcachedReconciler as it's receiver:

  ```golang
  type MemcachedReconciler struct {
        client.Client
        Scheme *runtime.Scheme
  }

  func (r *MemcachedReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error)
  ...
  ```
  
  In Go, a function which takes a receiver is usually called a method of the type (receiver). In our case, Reconcile is a method of MemcachedReconciler. 
  We can make calls such as:

  ```golang
  dep := r.deploymentForMemcached(memcached)
  ```

  Reconcile method is responsible for enforcing the 
  desired CR state on the actual state of the system. It runs each time an event occurs on a watched CR or resource, and will return some value 
  depending on whether those states match or not.

    In this way, every Controller has a Reconciler object with a Reconcile() method that implements the reconcile loop. The reconcile loop is passed 
    the Request argument which is a Namespace/Name key used to lookup the primary resource object, Memcached, from the cache: 

      ```golang
      func (r *MemcachedReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error)
      ```

      This function expects:
  
    - [Context](https://go.dev/blog/context): The context carries a deadline, a cancellation signal, and other values across API boundaries. The context       takes into account the identity of the end user, auth tokens, and the request's deadline. To view your current context:
        
        ```bash
        kubectl config view
        ```

    - [Request](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.7.0/pkg/reconcile#Request): Request contains the information necessary to reconcile a     Kubernetes object. This includes the information to uniquely identify the object - its Name and Namespace.

    The following are a few possible return options for a Reconciler:
    - with error:
      
      ```golang
      return ctrl.Result{}, err
      ```

    - without error, but reqeue request:
      
      ```golang
      return ctrl.Result{Reqeue: true}, nil 
      ```

    - to stop the Reconcile:
      
      ```golang
      return ctrl.Result{}, nil 
      ```

  - The client [Reader](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/v0.7.0/pkg/client/interfaces.go#L48) interface. Reader knows how to read and list Kubernetes objects. 
    - The [Get](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.7.0/pkg/client#Reader.Get) function - Use it to confirm that the observed resource, Memcached in our case, is defined in the namespace:

      ```golang
      memcached := &cachev1alpha1.Memcached{}
      err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, memcached)
      ```

      We aleady know the first 2 parameters, `context` and `request`. The `req` struct contains the `NamespacedName` which is the name and the namespace 
      of the object to reconcile. The object must be a struct pointer so that memcached can be updated with the response returned by the server. 
      In our case, that is the memcached object which must be a struct pointer so that memcached can be updated with the content returned by the Server.

    - The [List](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.7.0/pkg/client#Reader.List) function - List function can be used to retrieve a list all    child objects in a given namespace and list options. 
      In our case, we use List to retrieve all [memcached pods](./controllers/memcached_controller.go#L115). On a successful call, `Items` field in the list 
      will be populated with the result returned from the server:
  
      ```golang
      podNames := getPodNames(podList.Items)
      ```

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/golang:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/golang:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
